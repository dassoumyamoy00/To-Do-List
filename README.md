# To-Do List

## Introduction 

At some point of time, we always feel of jotting down the important activities/points in the form of list, so that it is visually attractive, at a glance to the user at any time.

Hence, I have tried to come up with a simple web application which can used as a To-Do List, or as a Shopping List.

## Features

1. Data of any length can be added without disturbing the interface
2. Once an activity/entry is done, it can be striked out by clicking on the radio button and again can be undone; without deleting that complete entry
3. Data from the list can be deleted in any order

## Languages

Completely Front-End based (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)

## Limitations

Since this is a front-end only project, hence the data/list entered by an user at a point of time could never be retrieved later on, once the browser is closed. This can be overcome by storing the information in a database for separate user logins. This would also enhance security.
